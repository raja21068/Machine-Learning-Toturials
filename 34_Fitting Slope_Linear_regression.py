# Fitting a Slope
# Letâ€™s try to fit a slope line through all the points such that the error
# The error could be positive or negative based on its location from the slope
# Y = mX + c, where Y is the predicted value for a given x value.
# m is the change in y, divided by change in x, that is, m is the slope of the line for the x variable
#  and it indicates the steepness at which it increases with every unit increase in x variable value
# c is the intercept that indicates the location or point on the axis where it intersects,

# Together the slope and intercept define the linear relationship between the two
# variables and can be used to predict or estimate an average rate of change

#Say a student is planning to study an overall of 6 hours in preparation for the test.
# Simply drawing a connecting line from the x-axis and y-axis to the slope shows that there is a possibility of him scoring 80.
